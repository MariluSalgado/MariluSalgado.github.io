<h3> Programing Intro </h3>
<p> I learned how to start a html file and start my own website. I also used CSS to style my website. It was easier once I actually seperated my Html file and my CSS file. I later used Javascript to add something with a function to my website. I added a two buttons that swutch between two photos. </p>
