  <h1> Coding Portfolio </h1> 
  
  <h2> Programing Intro </h2>
  <p> I learned how to start a html file and start my own website. I also used CSS to style my website. It was easier once I actually seperated my Html file and my CSS file that were linked together. I added a navagation bar to my website and changed background colors. I later used Javascript to add something with a function to my website. I added a two buttons that switch between two different photos. We also learned how to link pages to each other for the navagation bar. </p>
  

  <h2> CyberSecurity </h2>
  <img src="ceasar.gif">
  <p> I learned about hackers and the many ways they can hack. First of there are two types of hackers: White Hat (good hackers) & Black Hat (bad hackers). Black Hats usually try to get personal information about people whereas White Hats test the security of a website. There are also different kinds of cyber attacks. There are DDoS attacks and Phishing. DDoS is when they shut down a server by over loading it. Phsishing is basically when they catfish someone into giving private information about themselves throrugh a unsecure website. These are usually done by emails and messages. </p>


  <h2> Robotics </h2>
  <p> In this week my teammates built most of the robot while I was absent. When I came back they just needed to attach the arduino and the top peice of the arduino. We later tried to program the robot to do certain tasks. Our first problem was that our robot was running backwards because my teammates had placed the motors backwards and upsidedown. We fixed this problem in our code though. We basically just switched the code from "forwards" to "backwards". Our next problems was when our robot was going "forward", it was actually slightly moving to the left. We fixed this problem by making one wheel faster than the other to even it out. Our last and fatal problem was that our robot actually somehow messed up all the code. We were sharing our code with someone else and then our sensors no longer turned and they didnt sense anything. Our robot would no longer turn and it kept stoping. We tried to solve this problem by changing the sensors and the code but we no longer had time to work on out robot. So that was the end of our robo "Derp". </p>

  <h3> This is how our robots basically functioned by the end of the day. </h3>
