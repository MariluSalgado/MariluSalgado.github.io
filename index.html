	<h3>I am a senior at Carl Hayden High School. I am in Photography Club and am a formal member of the Falcon Robotics Team (842). I am currently taking a Senior Boot Camp with Be A Leader Foundation and a summer camp called Coding in Color. I am planning to study Computer Engineering or Computer Science. Since I love STEM so much I will be taking AP Physics and AP Computer Science this upcoming year. Hopefully these classes can benefit me and prepare me for college.</h3>
